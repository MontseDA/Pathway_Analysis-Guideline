# ueb-Pathway Analysis

The Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit (UEB) at Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR) is a support platform whose mission is to provide expert advice, services and training in bioinformatics and statistics for clinical and biomedical research.

At the bioinformatics platform of UEB we work with distinct omics data and apply our knowledge to provide researchers with accurate. reliable, robust (and, if possible, quick) results.

Many of our analyses deal with selecting some type of "feature" such as genes, proteins, microRNAs etc. which may act as a biomarkers for distinguishing, predicting or classifying distinct biological states. 

These analyses can be roughly separated in two parts: 
1. Obtaining a list of features, which is usually done applying some type of statistical or bioinformatical methods and 
2. Doing a biological interpretation of these lists using some type of *Pathway Analysis*. 
The  term *Pathway* or *Network Analysis* denotes any analytic technique that benefits from biological pathway or molecular network information to gain insight into a biological system. (Creixell et alt, Nature Methods 2015 (12 (7)). 

These repository is intended to grow progressively with information on *how to do pathway analysis* using open source tools.
We will first compile a list of tools and tutorials and will continue adding examples on how to do it using the same case studies so that a comparison between the results is facilitated.

The list of tools provided **is not intended to be exhaustive**, quite the contrary. Its main goal is helping researcher to select some good tools, preferably easy-to-use, and to guide them on how to do the analyses and how to interpret the results.

In order to facilitate its use the information is presented [as a wiki in this repository:] (https://github.com/uebvhir/ueb_Pathway_Analysis/wiki/UEB-Pathway-Analysis-Wiki)
